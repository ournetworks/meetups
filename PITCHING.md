# (Commercial) Pitch Policy

These meetup events are intended to be a space for folks to learn and discuss peer-to-peer and decentralized web topics. In order ensure we can do our best work together and reduce obstacles to participation, we have adopted an explicitly-documented [code](https://ournetworks.ca/code-of-conduct/) to communicate our expectations for conduct of both participants and organizers at any event.

However, given that the emphasis of the group is on learning and discussion, we are also dedicated to keeping the meetups a "*pitch-free zone*".

This means that meetups **will not** be an explicit promotional platform for the event organizers, any invited speakers, or members of the group. There will be no formal pitching, and no product info sessions at the events. Further, sponsors will be announced and the organizers will be transparent about how any sponsorship money is allocated.

While we welcome announcements and quick presentations from meetup participants, we request that they follow the above policy. We as organizers commit to doing the same.
