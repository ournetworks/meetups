# Email - Speaker Invite

Dear XXXX,

I'm an organizer of Our Networks (https://ournetworks.ca), both an annual conference and a series of bimonthly meetups around the past, present, and future of building our own network infrastructures. We've tried to take both "network" and "infrastructure" in a broad sense and think about activist, grassroots, and artistic rethinkings of both alongside technical.

We're scheduling our upcoming <Month> meetup and we'd love to invite [you/group name] as a speaker, we'd love to learn more about [TOPIC]

Because of the generous support of the Digital Justice Lab, for 2019 we are able to provide a modest honorarium to recognize the work that goes into preparing a presentation.

We have 40 minutes reserved for invited presentations, with the goal of one/two per meetup. The format for a presentation can be flexible! Formats could look like a 10-15 presentation with time for questions, a live coding session of an intro activity, and more...

Basic event logistics:
- 6:30 to 8:30 pm on Thursdays
- Invited speaker slots from 7:00 to 7:40pm
- We have a code of conduct and a (commercial) pitch-free zone policy: https://github.com/ournetworks/meetups/blob/master/PITCHING.md
- Events are located around the city with an emphasis on accessible space
- We (attempt to) live-stream or record the invited speakers
- Website with more information: https://ournetworks.ca/meetups/
- We also maintain a meetup group:  https://www.meetup.com/p2p-and-dweb-toronto/
